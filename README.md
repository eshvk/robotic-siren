=============

A collection of recommender algorithms used to try to improve 
recommendations on the [MMDS dataset][kaggle]. This is an ongoing project 
with one of my goals to try to make the (python) code as functional and 
robust as I can. However, the priority is to perform research on building
a better recommender. 


Refer [this][siren] for an explanation of the name.
